# 🌤️ Multi‑Agent Weather Assistant

## 📚 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple multi‑agent chat system using the `agents` and `openai` libraries. It’s designed to:
1. Prompt users for questions.
2. Detect if they ask about weather.
3. If yes, hand off to a dedicated **City Agent** that uses a dummy weather tool.
4. Otherwise, reply directly via the **Triage Agent**.

### Why This Approach?
- **Clear separation of concerns**: The triage agent handles general queries; the city agent handles weather.
- **Modular & scalable**: You can easily add more specialized agents (e.g., more tools or domains).
- Uses **decorators** (`@function_tool`) for easy tool registration.

---

## 🧠 Why This Architecture?

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent has one job—triage decides, city agent answers weather.
2. **Tool Abstraction**: The weather function is wrapped as a tool, making it easy to extend or replace.
3. **Structured Input/Output**: The `EasyInputMessageParam` provides consistent messaging, which is future‑proof.

---

## 🎯 Benefits of This Design

- **Maintainable**: Adding/removing agents or tools is as simple as updating arrays.
- **Extensible**: Swap in real-world weather APIs without touching core logic.
- **Robust**: Clear flow—even beginners can trace how queries move between agents.

|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Single agent for everything | Simpler at first                                   | Hard to maintain as responsibilities grow           |
| Central dispatcher function | Straightforward control                           | Moves decision logic outside agent framework        |
| Event-driven pipeline       | Great for complex workflows                       | Requires more setup, learning curve                 |

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- `agents` framework: Defines `Agent`, tool registration, and `Runner`.
- `openai`: For language model calls.
- `dotenv`: Loads API key from `.env`.
- `LitellmModel`: A wrapper around a model endpoint.
- Python built‑ins: `asyncio`, `os`, `random` (for dummy weather).

### 🔁 Data & System Flow
```

User input → triage\_Agent
├ if “weather in X” → handoff → city\_agent → calls weather() → returns answer
└ else → triage\_Agent replies directly


(Optional: Insert an ASCII or graphical flow diagram)

### ⚙️ Installation / Usage

1. **Clone** repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/you/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install agents openai python-dotenv
   ```
3. **Create `.env`** with:

   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
   ```
4. **Run demo**

   ```bash
   python your_module.py
   ```

   Type queries in console, e.g., “What’s the weather in Paris?”, or “Tell me a joke.”

## 💡 Best Practices & Key Decisions

* **Environment variables**: API keys are never hard‑coded—use `.env` for security.
* **Structured messaging**: `EasyInputMessageParam` ensures future extensibility.
* **Tool decorator**: `@function_tool` cleanly registers tool functions.
* **Hand‑off logic**: Agents pass work to each other, not just functions—professionally modular.

---

## 🔍 What Could Be Improved / Extended

1. **Real weather API**: Instead of `random`, call a real service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
2. **Error handling**: Add `try/except`, timeouts, and logging in `Runner.run`.
3. **Web or GUI interface**: Move away from console `input()`, e.g., build a Flask or Streamlit frontend.
4. **Additional agents & tools**:

   * A **NewsAgent** for news queries.
   * A **CalculatorAgent** for math.
   * Agents that support multiple data formats (images, files).
5. **Unit tests & CI integration**: Write automated tests for each agent and run them with GitHub Actions.

## ✅ Summary

This project illustrates a **modular**, **scalable** agent architecture using tool decorators and structured message passing. It’s easy to read, maintain, and extend.
Want to go next-level? Add real integrations, frontend, better error handling—and you’ll have a robust, production-grade multi-agent system.
