Hello!
Starting tomorrow, I will launch a new educational series called "OpenAI SDK: Deep Study". The goal of this series is to help beginners deeply understand the OpenAI Agents SDK so they can confidently attempt a complex quiz that I plan to hold after Eid.

In this series, I will share useful documentation links, and I would like you to:

Carefully read the provided OpenAI SDK documentation.

Translate and explain it clearly in Roman Urdu, using real-time code examples that are beginner-friendly.

Ensure the explanations are simple and understandable, especially for those new to the SDK.

After the explanation, please create a quiz based on the material you explained.

Quiz Requirements:
Create 20 multiple-choice MCQ.

The quiz should be in English.

The quiz should be at a graduate level (not beginner level).

At the end, provide the correct answers for all questions.

Hereâ€™s the first URL to begin with:
